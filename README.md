# -DQ.io-SQL_Guided_Project_Analyzing_CIA_Factbook_Data_Using_SQLite_and_Python
My take on DQ.io's Guided Project analyzing CIA World Factbook Data. The Main Goal of this Project was to read and work with SQL file in Python.

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

    population - The population as of 2015.
    population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
    area - The total land and water area.

Main goals:

    reading database files
    performing analysis on database files via python
    visualizing results
